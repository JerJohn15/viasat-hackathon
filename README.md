# Katrina-Victim-Finder-App

A data visualization application that catalogs missing individuals during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina crisis.

## Project Idea

The  idea is to show the location of missing individuals within New Orleans using **Google Maps** and also list a directory (which can be populated by the user) of each missing person and their status. The user has the ability to update and search an existing person's details, as well as add a new person into the database.
